# About TaxSmart

TaxSmart helps Canadians calculate personal sales taxes quickly by combining federal and provincial rules in a single, shareable interface.

## Why It Exists
- **Clarity:** Sales-tax treatment shifts by province and category. TaxSmart keeps the references in one place so you don’t have to memorize CRA bulletins.
- **Clarity for individuals:** Plan purchases, compare big-ticket items, or split receipts with confidence.
- **Shareable:** Send a link to family members or advisors instead of screenshots or spreadsheets.
- **Focus:** A lightweight front-end means fast load times and no account requirement for core functionality.

## Product Principles
1. Tie every rule to a verifiable CRA or provincial source.
2. Keep the interface accessible (WCAG AA contrast) and responsive.
3. Avoid invasive tracking; the calculator should stay distraction-free.

## Looking Ahead
Feature planning and monetization experiments run from a private backlog. Interested in early access or partnership opportunities? Email [taxapp@thesolutiondesk.ca](mailto:taxapp@thesolutiondesk.ca).
