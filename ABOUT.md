# About Canada Tax Smart Calc

Canada Tax Smart Calc exists to make Goods and Services Tax (GST), Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), Provincial Sales Tax (PST) and Québec Sales Tax (QST) scenarios transparent for small businesses, accountants, and Canadian shoppers.

## Why it exists
- **Fragmented guidance:** Sales-tax treatment differs per province and per product category. The calculator consolidates the federal CRA rules with province-specific rebates and exemptions.
- **Shareable context:** Quotes often need to be reviewed by teams or customers. Generating a share link with the configured line items eliminates screenshots and manual notes.
- **Accessible default dark theme:** Built for professionals who work late hours; light mode remains one click away.

## Product principles
1. **Source of truth:** Every calculation rule ties back to a CRA bulletin or provincial documentation.
2. **No tracking / ads:** The experience is focused on getting to the right tax number quickly.
3. **Offline-ready front-end:** Static build deploys anywhere; no server dependency.

## Roadmap ideas
- Persistently store custom tax categories per user.
- Add per-line effective tax rate summaries.
- Surface bilingual (EN/FR) UI copy options.
- Export calculations to CSV/PDF for invoicing systems.
