# Security Policy

## Supported versions
We support the latest commit on the `main` branch and tagged releases. Older commits are not actively maintained.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do **not** disclose security issues publicly. Instead, email <taxapp@thesolutiondesk.ca> with the following details:

- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code.
- Any mitigation or patches you propose.

We aim to acknowledge security reports within **48 hours** and provide an initial assessment or remediation plan within **7 days**. When a fix is ready, we will coordinate disclosure with you.

If you have not received a response within 5 business days, please follow up on the same thread.
